tagline: "A true paperback classic: Chew Your Own Avocado."

creator_notes: |
  This stage is inspired by those old "Cheese Your Own Advantage" books. You know the ones. 
  
  After each response, the stage generates some options for you, and you can enter a number to choose one or ignore them entirely. Either way, the LLM is instructed to narrate the details and outcome of your choice. 
  
  There's not much to this one; you can search for it in Chat Settings and drop it into any old chat to forfeit agency or abandon responsibility for your own writing. Have fun!

#   chat on desktop and above/in the top half of the chat on mobile.
# 'NONE' will not display, only run.
# 'COVER' will, indeed, cover the chat history completely,
#   but leave the text input box.
# 'FULLSCREEN' will make nothing below the header bar
#   show except for your stage.
